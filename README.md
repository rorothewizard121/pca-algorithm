# PCA-Algorithm
Implementation and explanation of the PCA algorithm for data analysis and compression.
With this process I wanted to get familiar with how the PCA algorithm works so I thought it best to try implementing it step by step.
In the notebook I provided two examples of use one being data analysis of the IRIS dataset and the other being compression of an image to show
how PCA is a lossy compression algorithm.

## Libraries Used:
- sklearn (importing iris data)
- PIL (image processing)
- NumPy (math)
- matplotlib (plotting)

## Features:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Plotting principal components
- Data compression and reconstruction
